        Hello! My name is Aashni!

        <h2>Charades</h2>
        <div class="favouriteGame">
            <p>I like playing Charades because you <strong>work in teams</strong> and have to act until your team guesses what you're trying to be.</p>
            <p>I especially like when we get to make our own Charades words, because then we can make really funny ones like <i>"a dancing monkey"</i>.</p>
