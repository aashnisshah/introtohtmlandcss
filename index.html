            <h2>Charades</h2>
            <div class="favouriteGame">
                <p>I like playing Charades because you <strong>work in teams</strong> and have to act until your team guesses what you're trying to be.</p>
                <p>I especially like when we get to make our own Charades words, because then we can make really funny ones like <i>"a dancing monkey"</i>.</p>

            <div class="howToPlay">
                <h3>Setting Up The Game</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>On multiple small pieces of paper, write out a word or phrase. One idea is to stick to a theme of "Movies", "Tv Shows" and "Books".</li>
                    <li>Fold each paper in half to hide what is written on the paper, and put them inside a hat or a bowl</li>
                    <li>Split your group into two teams</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Playing The Game: Do the following steps per team until all pieces of paper have been used</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select a team player who will do the acting for that round</li>
                    <li>That team player will randomly pick a piece of paper from the hat/bowl</li>
                    <li>When the team member has had time to read the paper, and signalled that they are ready, the opposing team will begin the timer</li>
                    <li>The team member with the paper will now have to act out whatever is on the paper, without saying any words verbally</li>
                    <li>While the team member acts, the rest of the team must guess what is being acted before time runs out</li>
                    <li>If the team is able to guess the word before time runs out, they get a point</li>
                    <li>The winner is the team with the most number of points at the end of the game</li>
                </ol>
